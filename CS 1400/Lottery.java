         /*ICA - Variable Name Checker
         Due Thursday by 1:30pm
         Write a program that checks the properness of a given variable name. More specifically, 
         your program should specify whether a user-entered variable name is:
         
         (1) illegal,
         
         (2) legal, but uses poor style, or
         
         (3) good.
         
         There are different opinions as to what constitutes good style for a variable name. For 
         this program, check for good style using these rules:
         
         --Only use letters and digits.
         --Use a lowercase letter for the first character.
         
         You don’t need to check for an uppercase letter for the first letter in the second word, 
         third word, etc (i.e. camel case).
         
         Sample session:
         
         This program checks the properness of a proposed Java variable name.
         Enter a variable name (q to quit): streetAddress2
         Good!
         Enter a variable name (q to quit): street address2
         Illegal.
         Enter a variable name (q to quit): StreetAddress2
         Legal, but uses poor style.
         Enter a variable name (q to quit): 2ndStreetAddress
         Illegal.
         Enter a variable name (q to quit): street$address$2
         Legal, but uses poor style.
         Submit your "VariableNameChecker.java" file*/
