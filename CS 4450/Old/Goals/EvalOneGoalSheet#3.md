## Eval Group One Goals
### Dates: 6.20.2016 - 7.6.2016

- Client Meeting Notes:
    - It has been found that the chitester people are building their side in python. We will continue to convert to NodeJS anyways, as it should be easily convertible to python if they want to keep our code.
- Build Stored Procedures that handle the database queries for the Pin Graph report request and the Promotion and Tenure report request (Some completed)
- Allow for choice between Pin Graph report and Promotion and Tenure report on the GUI (only worry about pin graph for now)
- Create the Pin Graph report creation page, which will differ slightly from the Promotion and Tenure report creation page (ignore promotion and tenure report creation)
- Ajax calls to the database from the GUI, resolve the error recieved on the GUI end to achieve data retrieval (completed)
