1. Convert most if not all (if we have time) of the original .NET project to NodeJS (javascript/html)
2. Implementing test database via NodeJS/Heroku 
    - Implement express-session or some form of session authentication
    - Structure express-session and other middleware to be extended by a 'create eval' use case
    - Document how to add features to our backend so that future classes don't re-invent the wheel or break things that are already working
    - This would be specifically for testing capabilities however should mirror the real database
3. Create a stable connection with NodeJS from the front end GUI that we built to the backend/database.
    - Dynamic queries that save to a JSON object
4. Complete GUI to run pingraph report with user selected parameter
    - Mobile vs. Web
    - This may or may not include user roles. As this is being written, that database is not available to us yet.
5. Clean up and organize the documentation, and connect and organize it with the other Eval Group.
    - Combine with second groups documentation
    - Finish documenting previous groups code and documents
    - Complete specifications document
    - Complete README for project setup
6. If available, get a working connection to a chitester sandbox server, to test against more data.
