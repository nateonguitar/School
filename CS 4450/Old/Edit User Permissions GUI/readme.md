## Quick ReadME

This is the GUI for allowing a User to set someones permissions of who they can view.
For example, say the User Selected is Ted Cowan, and we want him to be able to see the reports of Brad Peterson and Yong Zhang.
After selecting the User whose permissions you want to change, you are then supplied with a list of all users that they could 
potentially view as well as all users that they currently can view. This list does not include a User that is under Tenure.

This project will most likely change as it is a heavily desired feature from Brad and the university. As of right now, this section is not AJAX ready. The only thing for it that is 1000% working are the queries in the backend. All you should have to do is hook them up and it should work with no major issues. PLEASE see Brad for more information if my explanations are not making sense.

For more information on the operation of the GUI, you can find the documentation in the documentation folder above.
