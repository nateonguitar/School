It seemed they were only hired because of their degrees and professional work experience rather than their teaching skills.

Mr. Hilton is by far the best CS teacher I''ve ever had. I can also compare him with a C++ class that I registered for this same semester with a different online professor. I ended up dropping the other course, not because of the material, but because of the teacher. There are some teachers, like Mr. Hilton, that make learning fun and encourage students to do their best. I''ve run into too many other teachers that have forgotten that the enthusiasm they have for the subject matter greatly affects the learning experience of the student. A BS in CS can be intimidating, but with teachers like Mr. Hilton, he takes the fear factor out and uses encouragement and a "can do" attitude that his students can feed from to ultimately reach their goals.');

One thing that I particularly appreciated was Spencer Hilton''s accessibility.  Often with online courses it can feel like the material takes the lead and the instructor is almost not a part of the process.  This was not the case with Spencer.  He responded to emails in a timely manner (usually the same day that they were sent), he was active in the discussion forums and almost always replied to questions within 24 hours.  He checked my code when I was stuck on something and got back to me with enough time to work out my problems before the due date.

I took both CS 1030 and CS 1400 from Spencer Hilton and both were great courses.  I would recommend Spencer to anyone looking to take online courses in CS, and I will take more courses from him in the future if I can.');

That information I found extremely helpful I just wish it had been given to me day one. This class CANNOT be online. Completing the project was very difficult I had a lot of questions and felt they would have all been answered in a lecture style course. 

This class was most definitely a learning experience for all of us. I did complain a lot, especially about one of my partners who did absolutely nothing and when he would check up on the house all he would do is critique what I hadn''t done instead of applauding me for my work. It hurt my feelings because I had spent hours trying to get everything to work out properly. He would also proceed to tell me how stressed he was about this project which was CRAP because he hadn''t done a single thing. I can count on one hand all the things he did to contribute to our group. Anyway, I thought this was the complain about your partner section. If I had a do over I would have chosen a different partner. 

At the end of the day I don''t feel like this project was a total bust and I want you to realize that. I learned more about Revit in this class than in any of the others. Having the freedom to do what I wanted instead of following steps from a book gave me more ambition to complete the project. I wanted to win. I wanted to have the best design. I wanted to please the client. I wanted to prove myself to my partner ^ who thought he was a big shot because he worked in the industry (using Revit.) The desire to achieve all my goals from this project gave me the motivation to learn as much about Revit as I possibly could. The only thing that held me back was the time. I had to restart my project several times because things weren''t working out, or we changed the wall type, etc. Because of this I didn''t have time to get renderings of the house done. Now I could possibly lose the competition because of it. Long story short and I know you realize this is that this class CANNOT be taught online. I feel like I wouldn''t of had to start over several times if we had meant as a class. ');

The labs are well thought out and help illustrate concepts covered in lecture, but the majority of time we are sitting around waiting for a biopac machine. Dr. Skopec suggests taking the time to group study and to not "whine". This advice may be good for other students, but I can assure you as an A student, my time is much more valuable outside of a ''group study'' lab.

I would suggest trimming lab size if possible. If funding and space makes this impossible.. maybe offer the class as a 3 credit course with an optional 1 credit lab.

He then had us fix the code to get it to work for the assigned problem.  The problem with this approach to teaching programming is that it does not allow the student any freedom of thought nor ingenuity whilst programming.  There was no researching how the algorithm might be structured, no choice on methodology, no true learning nor mastery of the topic.  As an example, the 6th assignment on priority queue was given to us with well over 500 lines of code, requiring a dozen lines to fix and get to work to his specifications.  Other than seeing how Dr. Peterson chooses to go about setting up his data structure, we learn very little about how a priority queue works.  You do not learn math by reading equations, you learn it by solving equations.  You do not learn about algorithms and structures by looking at hundreds of lines of code and fixing a handful,  you learn by designing the structure yourself.  Dr. Peterson is unequivocally the worst, most inefficient professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking a class from.

He just said that he is grading us on representation and reflection on the papers we read even though he never told us as we were reading it that we will need to do this.  We must expand on all our papers and how they connect to us.  We JUST got told this and we were docked because of it!

Previous classes
Everyone had to share a personal story that changed their life or was pivotal in their life.  It came to him and he said he would not share.  I felt deflated
Has us do work and presentations THEN gives us the grading rubric.  Several groups had already presented before rubric even came out.
Would tell me, "Go deeper" for all my readings.  Would ask him what he meant, and he would be very vague on what it meant.  I would read the readings, see how I could relate the topics to me or my life experiences, then reflect on how I use this in my teaching.  He would say that it still was not good enough.
Would be told in our opinion talks during class that my thoughts and opinions were WRONG!  "I felt like this relates to this..."  No, was what I was told.  In a theoretical discussion, you can''t be WRONG.
ALL our first drafts got a 9/20.  This included work that was really well done and work that was poor.  If we are doing different levels of work according to the rubric, how are we all getting the same grade?  Just upsetting that I worked for 2 weeks then got a failing grade for my first draft.
Called out students that had come to him with problems.
This was graded as a PASS/FAIL class.  This is NOT an elective at SLCC!
ALL our discussions were about how we felt and how the author felt about various issues (oppression, race, gender equality, etc).  Not ONCE did we ever talk about how we can relate our feelings from our readings to make us better teacher.  Where is the transition?  
He just said...We as parents making our kids go to school is oppressive!  Any other way of thinking is naive!  WHAT?  How about following the law?  Educating kids?  
He just stated that UT is the highest state of oppression so that is why UT has the highest suicide rate in America.  UT doesn''t even break the top 10!  http://www.statemaster.com/graph/hea_sui_percap-health-suicides-per-capita  Is he making this up as he goes along?  He defended this by saying it was from a 2007 survey.  That is 7 years old.  I pointed this out and he rolled his eyes at me.
BTW, here is the 2007 survey.  UT was dead last!  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-11-28-depression-suicide-numbers_N.htm
Once again, IS HE MAKING THIS UP AS HE GOES ALONG?

It is unfortunate that I feel that I gained almost nothing from this class to help me with my MED degree.  I was glad when this class was over and will avoid this professor for any future classes.');

Jeremy is one of the smartest professors I''ve had, and I learn more from his classes than I do from any other professor, but there is one huge problem; this class (and many of Jeremy''s classes in general) was completely unorganized, chaotic, and inconsistent. From week to week, and even day to day, we had no clue what was expected, what was due, or what the heck was going on. This class would be perfect if Jeremy would set a schedule and stick to it. We got behind instantly, and by the 6th or 7th week, we were quite a few chapters behind in the book. This led to us having to do 3 chapters at a time for a number of weeks, and created huge amounts of unneeded stress for everybody in the class. I believe throwing in the Charrette on top of everything else was a poor choice as well, and probably one of the main causes of us getting behind. I know the Charrette project applied perfectly to what we were learning, but Jeremy should have planned better for it and gotten us a chapter or two ahead so that it wouldn''t have knocked us behind when it did come up. Being behind made the syllabus and canvas change every single week, and it was impossible to keep a set homework schedule. Lots of complaints were made, and the class was going downhill fast.

Having said all of this, I will give Jeremy a huge amount of credit for what he did in about the 9th week. We basically had a coming-to-Jesus (see urbandictionary.com) in class one day, and it completely changed the tone of the class for the last few weeks. He asked what we thought of the course thus far, and we told him exactly what we thought. We spent an entire class period letting him have it, every complaint we could throw, every issue we had with the class, every thing we thought he should change, and he took us completely seriously. He completely changed the way he ran the class, laid out the rest of the semester, took all of that added stress away, and created an environment where we could actually learn instead of worrying about what curve-ball was coming next. That day made me realize how much Jeremy really cares about each student, and how much he cares that we actually learn something from his classes. He was willing to change the way he wanted to do things, in order to give us a better environment to learn in. Every class period after that day was full of discussion, and in reality, it became my favorite class to go to. The last few weeks were absolutely perfect.

That being said, I have worked in the industry for a few years, and I will admit that I''m a little disappointed that this is an upper-division class. It seems that Weber is content producing a bunch of PHP "programmers" into the workforce. Sure, the students will be able to find jobs, but I feel like they will quickly forget basic computer science concepts and won''t be highly regarded in the workforce. I haven''t yet graduated from school but have had the opportunity to interview Weber State students for jobs in my field and they quickly forget Linked Lists and other common data structures. If this were something that could be taught earlier in the curriculum, it might be easier for students to dive into deeper concepts in CS.

Trying to stay on topic, I feel that this course should be taught earlier in the computer science curriculum. If this class is meant to teach students how to work in teams and what it''s like in the "real world", I think it would be helpful to teach them the agile methodology and how to organize around projects. Scrum may be overkill for these smaller projects, but I think students would benefit from the knowledge before they enter the workforce.

All that being said, I think the course is great. It exposed students (that may not have had the opportunity) to real-world projects. I only wish that more effort was put into showing students more about how modern software is built and was a lower-division class.');

I feel it would be beneficial for every student if there were more opportunity for Q. & A. There were some of the more difficult parts of the class such as calculations that were kind of glazed over and rushed through. I would have liked to have more instruction on that. Perhaps as a sign that the classroom is not understanding the material would be when they fail or hesitate to answer simple questions instead of answering the question for the class and expecting them to follow the path. I personally, was lost a lot of the time. I would also suggest a study guide for tests!

Often times I feel some professors at Weber State know their material, but lack the skill-set of an educator. Brad does not have this issue. 

Through some magical means he can travel at just the correct pace through material that no one get''s left behind while at the same time providing enough challenges for those that learn quick. He will often stop, literally every 5 minutes or 2 minutes depending on the content, and ask if everyone understands the topic. He wants to make sure no one get''s left out. He understands that usually the majority of students don''t understand things the first time and the ones that do understand are the only ones that answer to say that they do. IE: He knows when your confused you often don''t speak up. He makes sure that a concept is properly understood by all. I really want to highlight the fact he really pushes concepts NOT memorization. I think this is an important way of teaching most professors miss. By teaching concepts I am now able to understand the Data Structure and Algorithm concepts well enough to write most of them without reference material. (Would need reference for some Sorting Algorithms we really didn''t cover much). Most other classes I have had to keep reference material or write some stuff afterwards just to ingrain the concepts in my head. And I have even taken CS3030.

He also is easy to reach. Add him on google+ and you''ll get him at all hours of the day. Is he even paid on his time off? I think he just loves code!

Brad also leverages common sense technologies to cater to his students convenience. Having each lecture recorded on youtube to watch over and over was an immense help to understanding the material-which in turn is the reason I have learned so much and subsequently have an almost perfect grade. Google plus is also a perfectly simple and reliable platform for remote attendance. Brad understands that stringent structures with in class hand written/typed notes is NOT how people naturally learn. If every professor had a teaching structure like Brad''s I could bet both my cats and my dog that the drop out rate of the CS department would halve in one semester.

This is not brown nosing when I say Brad Peterson is the best professor I have had at Weber State and I would seriously consider querying his methods for implementation in all classes. It is for the benefit of all students and for Weber State (in terms of keeping students in the program and increasing success rates).

I did not like the top hat mainly because I was late to class often and don''t feel that i should lose points in the class as a result of being 10 minutes late. Granted, it is 5% of the grade so it isn''t a major issue. Admittedly, if i was late for class then i often would just not go because when you are late then you miss the sign in portion on top hat and usually i could just stay at home and answer the rest of the question while watching old lectures that overlapped with that day. I only mention this because i have to admit that if top hat was supposed to motivate me to go to class then more often then not I didn''t go to class because of it. But then again it did make me keep up with the material so I guess that it was successful in that regard.');

Since the bulk of the assignments were based on the XV6 operating system there is by design not a lot of online resources that you would normally have. I think that in order to compensate for the more restrictive availability the professor could make the following changes. 1 Lecture videos, A short pre-recorded lecture/assignment overview video could go a long way in clearing up issues that may arise when completing assignments. 2 slides detailing important concepts that are required for a given assignment. 3 Making participation in the discussion boards mandatory. Often the best resource for figuring out bugs or issues was the discussion board, however increased participation would of been helpful. 4. Quicker turn around on grading of assignments.

He also checks if things make sense and pushes people to speak up when something doesn''t make sense, which is a wonderful attribute because many times (including myself) I don''t feel comfortable interrupting the lecture. Brad is always available to help students and is great at getting people to figure out the answers themselves and learn the idea''s instead of just giving them the answer.
His code that he pre-constructs for assignments is stupendous! it helps you stay on track and lets you know when you are not doing something right. It really helped me understand the concepts and application behind the ideas that we were learning. He records and uploads his lectures that allows me to re-asses the information many times and catch the small important things that I miss. I can honestly say I would not have passed this course so easily if it wasn''t for the ability to go back and listen to the lectures again.
On top of Brad being a wonderful teacher, he also has a great personality that lets you approach him without hesitation. He keeps the class lively and entertaining while at the same time getting the message across. 
Brad Peterson is without a doubt the absolute best teacher at this university. I couldn''t recommend him enough for anyone who actually wants to learn something.');

		VALUES(206693678, 'Suggestions for improvement:

- Create structured lessons for the first assignment or two with lectures, examples, etc. It is unacceptable to simply tell students to figure it out when a fundamentally important topic such as client/server connections is introduced for the first time in the entire CS program. Students can manage to figure it out, but they only learn the wrong way to do things. Each assignment should provide students with an industry-accepted way of accomplishing a certain task.

- Improve the process for checking off assignments. It is not only frustrating to have four weeks worth of work checked off in two minutes after a superficial examination by the instructor, but it doesnt provide the student with any usable feedback. This check-off procedure suggests that as long as it works, it is good. I believe that CS students should be taught to a much higher quality standard than this.

- The course catalog description and the actual course do not match very closely. (Note that this is technically a violation of the student rights code). I recommend going through the appropriate curriculum updating process and changing the catalog description based on advisory committee feedback, then redesigning the course to match. 

-  Stop telling students that this is a 3000 level course, so I wont be holding your hand much. I dont need/want my hand held, but I do need/want a course which has undergone a careful instructional-design process, has stated learning outcomes, has instruction which demonstrates the concepts required to meet the outcomes, has activities in which those learning outcomes are accomplished, and has a way of assessing to see if those outcomes were met. As a quick example, the first assignment in the course could have been something like the following:

Outcome:
	
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
Create a simple client/server web application using the Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP (LAMP) technology stack, conforming to industry-accepted practices. 

Instruction:

Lecture(s), video(s), sample code, etc. Define an explain things like AJAX, XMLHttp, POST and GET requests, JSON, etc. (None of the previous CS courses contain any instruction on these). Show the correct way to build a simple PHP backend, show how to create a simple frontend which communicates with the backend. Show/explain why it is wrong to have all the PHP, HTML, and JavaScript code inline in the same file.

Activity:

Same as your actual first LAMP assignment, except require separate frontend and backend components (no inline PHP allowed). Have more well-defined deadlines, checkpoints, and due-dates. (Should be easier to do because less time will be wasted by students since they were given actual instruction). Have them create a backend first that can be tested with a tool such as PostMan. Next, have them create the frontend. 

Assessment:

Dont only check to see if their assignment works, spend some time looking at code and giving feedback. Are industry-accepted coding practices followed? What could they have done differently, more efficiently, more securely, etc.? 
The concept of various levels of hand-holding based on the level of course (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000) is, in my opinion, a flawed way of approaching education. I completely agree that the level of rigor should be appropriate for the course level, but that equate to less instruction being provided. 3000 and 4000 level courses still need to have instruction, just on different and more challenging concepts when compared to 1000 and 2000 level courses. In a 3000 level course, it is perfectly acceptable to expect students to know concepts that were covered in prerequisite courses, but this course requires students to know many concepts that werent covered in lower-division courses. There are two obvious solutions to this problem; either teach the concepts in lower-division courses, or teach them in this class.
